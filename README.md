# DeepRL_EmotionRecognition_UsingEEGsignals
 
 This is my B.S. project. In this project I used Deep Reinforcement Learning for recognizing emotions with EEG signals.
 the dataset that I worked with is the DEAP dataset.
 
## DEAP Dataset
you can download the dataset [here](http://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/mmv/datasets/deap/index.html)
